Hello, I'm Wenbo, and I will be joining the School of Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University in 2024 to pursue my Ph.D. degree, advised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).

In 2020, I graduated with honors and earned my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. I was subsequently offered a direct admission to graduate school at the School of Cyber Security at Sichuan University, where I continued my academic journey towards a Master's degree. During this stage, I had the privilege of being co-advised by Prof.Fang Yong and [Prof. Cheng Huang](https://chenghuang.org/). In 2023, I successfully obtained my Master's degree and was honored as an outstanding graduate by the Sichuan Provincial Government.

I look forward to continuing my academic pursuits at Nanyang Technological University.
